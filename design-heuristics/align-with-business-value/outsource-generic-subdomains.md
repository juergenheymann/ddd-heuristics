# Outsource generic subdomains

## short description

Sometimes dependencies are so generic that you don't want to invest time in it and you can either buy them off the shelf or use a SaaS functionality.

You only oursource when there is enough competition in that market

### examples

Payment providers like stripe, paypal etc.
Usermanagement, single sign-on like AWS or oath.com

## context

Use these at a strategic level when defining bounded context. When you want to seperate core domains from supporting and generic subdomains
