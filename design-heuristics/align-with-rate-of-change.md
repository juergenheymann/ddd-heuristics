# Align with rate of change

## short description

Group things that frequently change together to avoid coupling across boundaries.

## example

For instance a payment service, or a user profile service or an notification service.

## context

We should align boundaries in sociotechnical systems with our business processes to minimise dependencies and promote sustainable development practices.
