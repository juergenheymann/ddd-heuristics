# Don't outsource potential disruptive subdomains

## short description

Sometimes dependencies are so generic that you don't want to invest time in it and you want to buy them of the shelf: see [outsourced-generic-subdomains](Outsource generic subdomains)

But if the market is potentially disruptive, then the bought system or SaaS solution might slow you down because of lack of innovation.

### examples

The company that created slack

## context

Use these at a strategic level when defining bounded context. When you want to seperate core domains from supporting and generic subdomains
