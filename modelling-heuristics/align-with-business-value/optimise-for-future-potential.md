# Optimise for future potential
## short description
Even is sometime is core now, keep it as a seperate boundry anyway.
### example
one option is to have a discovery context which have search catalog and recommendations. But if you know that one of those things is going to be a key part of the business in the future and you want to improve one of those things prematturly optimize so you can iterate on this bounded context faster.
## context
Use these at a strategic level when defining bounded context. When you want to seperate core domains from supporting and generic subdomains
