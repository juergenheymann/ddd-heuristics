# Align with source of change

## short description

align boundaries with the people asking for changes because those people will care about concepts which are likely to be more closely related.

## example

separate business-to-business and business-to-consumer services because both customer segments will have different needs.

## context

We should align boundaries in sociotechnical systems with our business processes to minimise dependencies and promote sustainable development practices.
